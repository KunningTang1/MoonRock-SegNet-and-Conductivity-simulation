This program solves Laplace's equation in a porous conducting material using the finite element method to simulate the electrical conductivity of a 3D digital image. Each pixel in the 3D digital image is a cubic tri-linear finite element,  having its own conductivity. Periodic boundary conditions are maintained.  In the comments below, (USER) means that this is a section of code that the user might have to change for his particular problem.
